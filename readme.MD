Arizona State University has a large intake of students every year, for both undergraduates and graduates. This database project proposal focuses on creating an enrollment projections for the future year and to update those projections annually. The projections are developed to assist the school division in planning for and managing the current and future impacts of enrollment. These impacts include staff, facilities and other resources such as furniture, textbooks, and supplies. Planning to meet these needs enhances the universityâ€™s ability to achieve excellence by design and equality in education for its students. For our initial proposal, we will be focusing on a single year of enrollment. This database will catalog details of all the students who have applied to the university. The data will then be used to predict the final number of students enrolling for that particular year, which will be presented to users on a well developed and user-friendly front-end interface.
